## What is tsaugur?
`tsaugur` is a low-code Python package for time series forecasting. It allows data scientists to fit, tune, compare, evaluate, ensemble  and visualize a range of models quickly and with just a few lines of code.  

`tsaugur` is basically a unified interface to a number of Python libraries for time series prediction, such as `prophet`, `statsmodels`, `tbats`, `pmdarima`, `pydlm` and more, plus some ensembling and plotting features.
